# Changelog

## What's new in version 0.5.3

- added a Notifications settings section with a master Windows notifications switch plus separate toggles for subscription and completed-download notifications
- completed audio, video, batch, playlist, and channel downloads can now send Windows notification center messages when ApricotPlayer is not focused, while in-app popup behavior is preserved when the app is focused
- rebuilt Keyboard shortcuts editing so focusing a shortcut field and pressing a key combination captures it directly; Tab and Shift+Tab still move between fields
- translated the new notification and shortcut-capture text across the supported language packs

## What's new in version 0.5.2

- verified the GitHub repository is public and simplified the updater to use the public ApricotPlayer release endpoints without user-facing owner, repo, or private token settings
- added a Keyboard shortcuts settings section with accessible editable shortcut fields and saved custom shortcuts
- added braille-friendly NVDA announcements by sending both speech and braille messages and raising status bar accessibility events
- changed empty list boxes to expose readable placeholder items such as No results, No favorites, No subscriptions, and No queued downloads instead of leaving screen readers on unknown
- added 15 language choices and translated the new shortcut, empty-list, and important status/announcement strings
- Settings now announces Settings saved when the Save button is pressed

## What's new in version 0.5.1

- fixed the search result context menu so channels and playlists no longer show single-video actions such as Play, Download audio, or Download video
- channel and playlist result context menus now show collection-aware actions such as Open channel videos, Open playlist videos, Download channel, or Download playlist
- added a New videos action in Subscriptions that opens only the videos found since the last subscription check
- pressing Enter on a subscribed channel opens all channel videos, and Escape returns to the Subscriptions list
- tightened library item handling so saved channel and playlist items open as collections instead of being treated as single videos

## What's new in version 0.5.0

- added a History screen for recently played and downloaded items, with keyboard and context menu actions for play, download, favorite, subscribe, copy URL, remove, and clear history
- added a Subscriptions screen for YouTube channels, including Ctrl+Shift+S subscription shortcuts, context menu subscription actions, manual checks, and automatic background checks
- added Windows notifications for new videos from subscribed channels, with settings for automatic checks, check interval, and notifications
- added optional system tray behavior so the close button or Alt+F4 can hide ApricotPlayer to the tray while the Exit command still closes it completely
- renamed the portable release package to `ApricotPlayer.zip` while keeping updater compatibility with the old portable asset name

## What's new in version 0.4.7

- changed the yt-dlp component update check so screen readers only announce "updating components" after a newer yt-dlp package has actually been found and installation is starting
- kept no-update startup checks quiet so ApricotPlayer does not announce component updating when there is nothing to install
- published updated installer and portable release assets for testing updates from 0.4.6

## What's new in version 0.4.6

- fixed update checks on systems where Python/OpenSSL could not find a trusted certificate authority by using the bundled `certifi` certificate store for GitHub and PyPI HTTPS requests
- changed the app updater to exit ApricotPlayer immediately after launching the updater helper instead of relying on a delayed UI timer, preventing the old window from getting stuck as not responding
- updater helper scripts now wait up to 15 seconds for ApricotPlayer to close and then force-close only that ApricotPlayer process if needed, instead of waiting up to 180 seconds
- kept installer and portable ZIP update paths aligned so both release assets use the same certificate and shutdown fixes

## What's new in version 0.4.5

- added a Current downloads screen that shows pending and active downloads together, including batch progress, current item, remaining count, and cancel controls
- queued channels and playlists can now be downloaded together with queued videos, including audio or video mode
- the result context menu now offers `Download all selected items` when more than one item is queued
- new default settings use dynamic result loading, shown as `Dynamic (loads 20 at a time)` instead of a raw `0`
- YouTube search now defaults to `All`, followed by videos, playlists, and channels
- channel and playlist result rows no longer show irrelevant view counts
- pressing Escape from a channel or playlist result list now returns to the previous search results instead of the main menu
- the yt-dlp component updater now checks PyPI in the background, installs newer yt-dlp code into the per-user components folder, and announces updating/done through the screen reader
- added translations for the new download status and component-update messages across all supported UI languages

## What's new in version 0.4.4

- fixed the update dialog buttons by binding `Update now` and `Skip this version` directly to the modal result instead of relying on implicit wx dialog behavior
- `Skip this version` now announces and updates the status immediately, so screen-reader users know the choice was saved
- updater diagnostics now start logging as soon as the update prompt is shown, including button choice, download start, downloaded package size, and script launch path
- verified the update prompt programmatically: `Skip this version` returns skip and `Update now` returns update

## What's new in version 0.4.3

- changed the default video download format to MP4 so normal video downloads no longer default to WebM
- added friendly video download format choices in Settings: MP4 recommended, best available, MP4 single file, and smallest file
- migrated the old `bestvideo+bestaudio/best` setting to the new MP4 recommended mode automatically
- video downloads now set `merge_output_format` to `mp4` for MP4 modes
- translated the new video format labels across all supported UI languages

## What's new in version 0.4.2

- made mpv IPC commands serialized and retry-aware so pitch changes no longer fail when the player pipe is still starting or briefly busy
- made pitch changes retry silently instead of announcing a transient `Pitch control is not available yet` message
- verified the bundled mpv accepts pitch property changes, Rubberband filter insertion, and runtime Rubberband `set-pitch` commands through JSON IPC

## What's new in version 0.4.1

- added ten more UI languages: German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Polish, Dutch, Swedish, Croatian, and Serbian
- fixed remaining untranslated Slovenian settings and player strings
- changed the language selector to use the shared language registry instead of a hard-coded Slovenian/English toggle
- localized pitch-control mode labels while keeping the saved settings values stable
- added a README localization policy so every future UI change is translated across all supported languages in the same release

## 0.4

- added `All` to YouTube search so videos, playlists, and channels can appear in one result list
- added context-menu downloads for playlist and channel results; ApricotPlayer creates a dedicated folder under the configured download folder and downloads the videos there
- changed release assets going forward to `ApricotPlayerSetup.exe` plus `ApricotPlayerPortable.zip`; the raw single-file exe is no longer published by default
- added portable ZIP updater support so portable builds can update by downloading and extracting the new ZIP into the current app folder
- restored linked pitch/speed mode as `Linked pitch and speed - pitch keys change both`; pitch keys now adjust pitch and speed together, while speed keys still adjust only speed

## 0.3.8

- renamed the startup app update setting to simply `Check for updates at startup`
- added a manual `Check for updates` button in Settings that checks the latest GitHub release immediately
- manual update checks ignore a previously skipped version so users can retry an update without editing their settings file
- manual update checks announce the result for screen readers

## 0.3.7

- fixed the runtime Rubberband `set-pitch` IPC call so pitch changes update the existing labeled filter instead of recreating it
- kept pitch and playback speed independent while making repeated pitch key presses smoother

## 0.3.6

- rebuilt player pitch control so pitch and playback speed remain independent in every supported pitch mode
- removed the confusing legacy `linked speed` pitch mode; old settings using it now migrate to the recommended independent Rubberband mode
- renamed pitch mode choices to describe what they do directly: best-quality Rubberband independent pitch or basic mpv built-in independent pitch
- Rubberband pitch changes now update the labeled mpv audio filter instead of replacing the whole audio filter chain or changing playback speed

## 0.3.5

- installer builds now use PyInstaller `onedir` layout so installed launches no longer pay the one-file extraction cost every time
- portable `ApricotPlayer.exe` remains available as a single-file build for quick sharing
- installer script now supports packaging either a single executable or a full application directory
- installer updates clean the old `_internal` runtime folder before installing the new one-dir runtime
- release build script now supports `-PackageMode onefile` and `-PackageMode onedir`

## 0.3.4

- optimized the Windows build by removing the broad `--collect-all wx` bundle step
- excluded unused heavyweight modules from the packaged app, including IPython, matplotlib, numpy, PIL, tkinter, and jedi
- reduced the installed executable size and one-file startup unpacking work for faster launches
- deferred loading `yt-dlp` until search, playback, downloads, cookies export, or update checks actually need it, so the main menu can appear sooner
- delayed automatic YouTube/app update checks for a few seconds after startup so they no longer compete with the first menu render

## 0.3.3

- download actions now always speak `Download started.` before the download worker starts, independent of the completion popup setting
- download worker startup is delayed slightly so very fast downloads cannot immediately override the screen-reader start announcement

## 0.3.2

- settings are now split into keyboard-friendly sections: General, Playback, Downloads, Cookies and network, and Updates and advanced
- when a cookies file is configured, ApricotPlayer no longer also tries to read browser cookies, avoiding Chrome cookie database lock errors
- added an export/cache browser cookies action that writes `%APPDATA%\ApricotPlayer\cookies.txt` and then switches browser cookie extraction off
- download hotkeys now leave a short delay after announcing `Downloading audio...` or `Downloading video...` before starting the worker, so screen readers can speak the start message

## 0.3.1

- fixed `Ctrl+Shift+A` and `Ctrl+Shift+D` by registering them as app-wide download accelerators and handling them from the player panel
- made result/player download shortcut detection more reliable for Windows key events
- added a clearer Chrome cookie database error hint, including closing Chrome or using Edge, Firefox, or cookies.txt
- pitch failures now announce that pitch control is unavailable instead of saying timing is unavailable
- installer-based updates now request the desktop shortcut task so installed test builds stay easy to launch

## 0.3

- public README no longer references local development download paths
- added an Inno Setup based Windows installer build that installs ApricotPlayer into the standard Windows Programs folder
- installer adds a Start Menu shortcut and offers an optional desktop shortcut
- updater now prefers `ApricotPlayerSetup.exe` when a release provides it, then falls back to the portable `.exe`
- updater now checks GitHub's `/releases/latest` endpoint instead of assuming the release list is ordered correctly
- release publishing now uploads both the portable executable and installer when both exist

## 0.2.2

- added a `Cookies from browser` setting for YouTube sign-in/bot-check cases
- yt-dlp now receives browser cookies for search, playback, playlist/channel loading, and downloads when this setting is enabled
- YouTube authentication/bot-check errors now include a direct Settings hint

## 0.2.1

- fixed packaged playback failing with `NoneType` stream write errors
- queued downloads now open a dedicated `Queued videos for download` screen instead of a hidden main-menu `Download all` action
- queued download screen supports downloading the selected item, audio/video context menu actions, `Ctrl+Shift+A`, `Ctrl+Shift+D`, and a tab-reachable `Download all` button
- batch downloads now clear the queue immediately so the queued option disappears once there is nothing waiting
- batch downloads announce when they start and when each queued item begins downloading

## 0.2

- updater install flow no longer waits behind a final OK dialog; it logs to `%APPDATA%\ApricotPlayer\updater.log`, exits the app, replaces the `.exe`, and restarts
- video details are created only after pressing `V`; `Escape` closes details back to the player before returning to results
- added `F2` volume boost with screen-reader announcements and automatic clamp back to 100 when disabled
- added cross-search batch download queue with `Shift+A` for audio and `Shift+D` for video
- main menu now shows `Download all` dynamically when the batch queue has items

## 0.1.4

- speed and pitch hotkeys now default to `0.01x` steps
- settings now include playback speed step, pitch step, and pitch control mode
- pitch control defaults to a higher-quality rubberband filter, with optional mpv pitch and linked-speed modes
- `Ctrl+Shift+A` and `Ctrl+Shift+D` are handled more reliably in both results and player mode
- downloads now announce start and can either show a completion popup or only speak completion through the screen reader

## 0.1.3

- updater now shows a visible progress dialog immediately after `Update now`
- updater errors are now shown in an error dialog instead of only the status bar
- updater now prefers the public GitHub `browser_download_url` and falls back to the API asset URL
- playback speed announcements now always use two decimals such as `0.25x`, `0.50x`, and `1.10x`
- speed control now includes `0.25x`

## 0.1.2

- default language for new installs is now English
- settings are always saved to the user's `%APPDATA%\ApricotPlayer\settings.json`
- settings screen now includes a settings file path and a Restore to defaults button
- player announcements now try NVDA speech directly through `nvdaControllerClient`
- `T`, `V`, `L`, speed changes, and pitch changes now use the same announcement path
- video details now use a standard multiline read-only text field for better screen reader reading, arrow navigation, and copying
- speed and pitch controls now have finer steps, including `1.1x`
- reaching default `1.0x` speed or pitch plays a short confirmation sound
- dynamic results mode now fetches the first 20 results first, then fetches more only when needed
- context menu download items now show `Ctrl+Shift+A` and `Ctrl+Shift+D`

## 0.1.1

- updater now uses a PowerShell replacement script that waits for the old app process to exit before copying the new `.exe`
- updater now validates that the downloaded file is a Windows executable before replacing the app
- Escape from player mode now returns focus directly to the results list instead of the search field
- switched versioning from beta suffixes to normal `0.1.x` releases

## 0.1.0-beta.4

- update prompt title is now `Update available`
- update prompt now shows `Version ...`, `What's new?`, and `Do you want to update now?`
- update prompt buttons are now `Update now` and `Skip this version`
- skipped app update versions are remembered so the same release is not offered repeatedly

## 0.1.0-beta.3

- player announcements now raise explicit Windows accessibility events for screen readers
- `T` duration announcements should be spoken by NVDA instead of only changing the status bar
- `S` and `D` now use predictable playback speed steps such as `0.5x`, `0.75x`, and `1.0x`
- this release is built outside the user's Downloads folder to test the auto-updater path

## 0.1.0-beta.2

- updater now shows the release changelog before asking to install the update
- GitHub release publishing now requires release notes
- added pitch control in player mode with `Ctrl+Up` and `Ctrl+Down`
- kept `S` and `D` for playback speed control
