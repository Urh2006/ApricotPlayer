# Changelog

## 0.3.7

- fixed the runtime Rubberband `set-pitch` IPC call so pitch changes update the existing labeled filter instead of recreating it
- kept pitch and playback speed independent while making repeated pitch key presses smoother

## 0.3.6

- rebuilt player pitch control so pitch and playback speed remain independent in every supported pitch mode
- removed the confusing legacy `linked speed` pitch mode; old settings using it now migrate to the recommended independent Rubberband mode
- renamed pitch mode choices to describe what they do directly: best-quality Rubberband independent pitch or basic mpv built-in independent pitch
- Rubberband pitch changes now update the labeled mpv audio filter instead of replacing the whole audio filter chain or changing playback speed

## 0.3.5

- installer builds now use PyInstaller `onedir` layout so installed launches no longer pay the one-file extraction cost every time
- portable `ApricotPlayer.exe` remains available as a single-file build for quick sharing
- installer script now supports packaging either a single executable or a full application directory
- installer updates clean the old `_internal` runtime folder before installing the new one-dir runtime
- release build script now supports `-PackageMode onefile` and `-PackageMode onedir`

## 0.3.4

- optimized the Windows build by removing the broad `--collect-all wx` bundle step
- excluded unused heavyweight modules from the packaged app, including IPython, matplotlib, numpy, PIL, tkinter, and jedi
- reduced the installed executable size and one-file startup unpacking work for faster launches
- deferred loading `yt-dlp` until search, playback, downloads, cookies export, or update checks actually need it, so the main menu can appear sooner
- delayed automatic YouTube/app update checks for a few seconds after startup so they no longer compete with the first menu render

## 0.3.3

- download actions now always speak `Download started.` before the download worker starts, independent of the completion popup setting
- download worker startup is delayed slightly so very fast downloads cannot immediately override the screen-reader start announcement

## 0.3.2

- settings are now split into keyboard-friendly sections: General, Playback, Downloads, Cookies and network, and Updates and advanced
- when a cookies file is configured, ApricotPlayer no longer also tries to read browser cookies, avoiding Chrome cookie database lock errors
- added an export/cache browser cookies action that writes `%APPDATA%\ApricotPlayer\cookies.txt` and then switches browser cookie extraction off
- download hotkeys now leave a short delay after announcing `Downloading audio...` or `Downloading video...` before starting the worker, so screen readers can speak the start message

## 0.3.1

- fixed `Ctrl+Shift+A` and `Ctrl+Shift+D` by registering them as app-wide download accelerators and handling them from the player panel
- made result/player download shortcut detection more reliable for Windows key events
- added a clearer Chrome cookie database error hint, including closing Chrome or using Edge, Firefox, or cookies.txt
- pitch failures now announce that pitch control is unavailable instead of saying timing is unavailable
- installer-based updates now request the desktop shortcut task so installed test builds stay easy to launch

## 0.3

- public README no longer references local development download paths
- added an Inno Setup based Windows installer build that installs ApricotPlayer into the standard Windows Programs folder
- installer adds a Start Menu shortcut and offers an optional desktop shortcut
- updater now prefers `ApricotPlayerSetup.exe` when a release provides it, then falls back to the portable `.exe`
- updater now checks GitHub's `/releases/latest` endpoint instead of assuming the release list is ordered correctly
- release publishing now uploads both the portable executable and installer when both exist

## 0.2.2

- added a `Cookies from browser` setting for YouTube sign-in/bot-check cases
- yt-dlp now receives browser cookies for search, playback, playlist/channel loading, and downloads when this setting is enabled
- YouTube authentication/bot-check errors now include a direct Settings hint

## 0.2.1

- fixed packaged playback failing with `NoneType` stream write errors
- queued downloads now open a dedicated `Queued videos for download` screen instead of a hidden main-menu `Download all` action
- queued download screen supports downloading the selected item, audio/video context menu actions, `Ctrl+Shift+A`, `Ctrl+Shift+D`, and a tab-reachable `Download all` button
- batch downloads now clear the queue immediately so the queued option disappears once there is nothing waiting
- batch downloads announce when they start and when each queued item begins downloading

## 0.2

- updater install flow no longer waits behind a final OK dialog; it logs to `%APPDATA%\ApricotPlayer\updater.log`, exits the app, replaces the `.exe`, and restarts
- video details are created only after pressing `V`; `Escape` closes details back to the player before returning to results
- added `F2` volume boost with screen-reader announcements and automatic clamp back to 100 when disabled
- added cross-search batch download queue with `Shift+A` for audio and `Shift+D` for video
- main menu now shows `Download all` dynamically when the batch queue has items

## 0.1.4

- speed and pitch hotkeys now default to `0.01x` steps
- settings now include playback speed step, pitch step, and pitch control mode
- pitch control defaults to a higher-quality rubberband filter, with optional mpv pitch and linked-speed modes
- `Ctrl+Shift+A` and `Ctrl+Shift+D` are handled more reliably in both results and player mode
- downloads now announce start and can either show a completion popup or only speak completion through the screen reader

## 0.1.3

- updater now shows a visible progress dialog immediately after `Update now`
- updater errors are now shown in an error dialog instead of only the status bar
- updater now prefers the public GitHub `browser_download_url` and falls back to the API asset URL
- playback speed announcements now always use two decimals such as `0.25x`, `0.50x`, and `1.10x`
- speed control now includes `0.25x`

## 0.1.2

- default language for new installs is now English
- settings are always saved to the user's `%APPDATA%\ApricotPlayer\settings.json`
- settings screen now includes a settings file path and a Restore to defaults button
- player announcements now try NVDA speech directly through `nvdaControllerClient`
- `T`, `V`, `L`, speed changes, and pitch changes now use the same announcement path
- video details now use a standard multiline read-only text field for better screen reader reading, arrow navigation, and copying
- speed and pitch controls now have finer steps, including `1.1x`
- reaching default `1.0x` speed or pitch plays a short confirmation sound
- dynamic results mode now fetches the first 20 results first, then fetches more only when needed
- context menu download items now show `Ctrl+Shift+A` and `Ctrl+Shift+D`

## 0.1.1

- updater now uses a PowerShell replacement script that waits for the old app process to exit before copying the new `.exe`
- updater now validates that the downloaded file is a Windows executable before replacing the app
- Escape from player mode now returns focus directly to the results list instead of the search field
- switched versioning from beta suffixes to normal `0.1.x` releases

## 0.1.0-beta.4

- update prompt title is now `Update available`
- update prompt now shows `Version ...`, `What's new?`, and `Do you want to update now?`
- update prompt buttons are now `Update now` and `Skip this version`
- skipped app update versions are remembered so the same release is not offered repeatedly

## 0.1.0-beta.3

- player announcements now raise explicit Windows accessibility events for screen readers
- `T` duration announcements should be spoken by NVDA instead of only changing the status bar
- `S` and `D` now use predictable playback speed steps such as `0.5x`, `0.75x`, and `1.0x`
- this release is built outside the user's Downloads folder to test the auto-updater path

## 0.1.0-beta.2

- updater now shows the release changelog before asking to install the update
- GitHub release publishing now requires release notes
- added pitch control in player mode with `Ctrl+Up` and `Ctrl+Down`
- kept `S` and `D` for playback speed control

## 0.1.0-beta.1

- initial private beta release
- GitHub-based updater for the packaged `.exe`
- dynamic results loading
- in-app playback
- download progress reporting
